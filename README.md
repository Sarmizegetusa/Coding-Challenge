# Coding-Challenge

Based on the API documentation, use the Laravel framework to implement working endpoints for Create Purchase and Retrieve List of Purchases.

    https://github.com/Sarmizegetusa/Coding-Challenge/wiki/API

This will include creating database tables and models for the Purchase and Offering objects.

Write tests for the endpoints using whatever PHP testing framework you like, but given the time constraints you're free to write tests in an add hoc fashion.

Use basic authentication and perform the necessary argument validations and error checking. If you find that anything in the documentation is not clearly specified, then just take your best guess and move on.
